 # 🧑‍💻 My_Portfolio_V3

Welcome to the third version of my personal portfolio — built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and bootstrapped using [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## 🚀 Getting Started

To run the development server locally:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Once it's running, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

Start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The app supports hot reloading, so your changes will update automatically.

## 📡 API Routes

API routes are available at [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello).  
They can be modified in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*` and is used for building backend functionality.

## 🖋 Fonts

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) for optimal font loading, specifically using Inter from Google Fonts.
